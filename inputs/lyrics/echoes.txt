[Intro]
(Ooh)
The echo remains
Drifting away

[Verse]
The coffee cup is cold upon the table
I tried to speak but I am not able
The rain is tapping softly on the glass
Watching the seconds turn to hours and pass
Your sweater is still hanging by the door
A ghost of you I cannot touch anymore

[Prechorus]
The room is too big without you here
Every silence feels like fear
I am drowning in the atmosphere

[Chorus]
It is the echo in the hall
It is the writing on the wall
I call your name into the night
But nothing ever feels quite right
Just a memory drifting deep
In the secrets that we keep

[Verse]
I walk the streets we used to know so well
Caught in this quiet, lonely spell
The streetlights flicker in the midnight mist
Tracing the shadows of the lips I kissed

[Bridge]
Time moves slow like honey dripping down
I am the stranger in my own town
Waves crashing in a sea of blue
Everything leads me back to you

[Chorus]
It is the echo in the hall
It is the writing on the wall
I call your name into the night
But nothing ever feels quite right

[Outro]
Just the reverb
Fading out
Without a doubt
I miss you
(Miss you)
